## Goal and priorities

* I want to get necessary skills for work as *frontend-developer*. I like solving different problems.
* I master any information enough quickly. For instance, I have been starting to get English classes since February this year. To be more precise, I have been studying English for 6 months. And I have improved fluency in the English language from Beginner to Pre-Intermediate. I am getting better results, at least Upper-Intermediate.

## Skills
* I have known basis of ***JavaScript, Git, HTML&CSS*** and ***Markdown***.
* I use tools for the developing  such as ***Visual Studio Code, Bracket*** and ***Git Bash***.

**This is my first HTML-file**:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My project</title>
        <script src="src/script.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <script>
            hello();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
I have no experience in Frontend-Development scope, because I have just begun to explore.
